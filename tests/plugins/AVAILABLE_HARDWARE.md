# Available Hardware

Veertu Inc provides a small amount of ARM64/Silicon hardware for testing purposes. We have private scripts that act based on the manifest definition yaml files in the anklet repo to request hardware from our private infrastructure, set up the anklet and plugins on it, and then execute tests against it.
