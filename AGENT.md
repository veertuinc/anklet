# Agent Configuration

## Project Overview

Read over the README.md file for an overview of Anklet and how it works.

Inside of each folder there are .md files detailing the specific features or files. Review these md files to understand a bit about how it works.

## Rules

- Use DRY when possible to not repeat yourself.
- Never comment out code or tests to "fix" an issue.

## Development Commands

- `make go.lint` - Run linter
- `make go.test` - Run tests
- `./tests/cli-test.bash` - Run CLI tests

## Post Changes

- Always run `make go.lint` and do not do your own linting.
